Generate your first AI image with the Firemoon Studio API.

### Step 1: Get your API key

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion icon="shield" title="API key security">

### Step 2: Make your first API call

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Generate an image with FLUX">
    Use this cURL command to generate your first image:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://firemoon.studio/api/v1/flux/dev \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "prompt": "A beautiful sunset over mountains",
        "num_images": 1,
        "image_size": "landscape_4_3",
        "guidance_scale": 3.5

    const client = new FiremoonStudio({
      apiKey: process.env.FIREMOON_API_KEY
    });

    const result = await client.generate.image({
      provider: 'flux',
      model: 'dev',
      prompt: 'A serene mountain landscape',
      num_images: 1
    });
