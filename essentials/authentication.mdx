## API Key Authentication

All requests to the Firemoon Studio API require authentication using an API key in the `Authorization` header.

## Getting Your API Key

Create your API key directly from the Firemoon Studio dashboard:

1. Sign in to [Firemoon Studio](https://firemoon.studio)
2. Navigate to the [API Keys page](https://firemoon.studio/keys)
3. Click "Add key" button
4. Enter a description (e.g., "Production API key" or "Development key")
5. Click "Create key"
6. **Copy your API key immediately** - you won't be able to see it again after closing the dialog

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. Once created, store it safely as you cannot view it again in the dashboard.
</Warning>

### Managing API Keys

You can create multiple API keys for different purposes:
- **Development**: For local testing and development
- **Staging**: For staging environment testing
- **Production**: For live production applications

Each key can be deleted individually if compromised or no longer needed.

## Using Your API Key

Include the API key in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` prefix:

```
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here
```

## Example Requests

### cURL
```bash
curl -X POST https://firemoon.studio/api/v1/flux/dev \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "A beautiful sunset"}'
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://firemoon.studio/api/v1/flux/dev', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your_api_key_here',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    prompt: 'A beautiful sunset'
  })
});
```

### Python
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'https://firemoon.studio/api/v1/flux/dev',
    headers={
        'Authorization': 'Bearer your_api_key_here',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    json={'prompt': 'A beautiful sunset'}
)
```

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
Store your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
# .env
FIREMOON_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

```javascript
// JavaScript
const apiKey = process.env.FIREMOON_API_KEY;
```

```python
# Python
import os
api_key = os.getenv('FIREMOON_API_KEY')
```

### Key Rotation
- Rotate API keys regularly (recommended: every 30-90 days)
- Use different keys for different environments (dev/staging/prod)
- Immediately revoke compromised keys

### Monitoring
- Monitor API usage in your dashboard
- Set up alerts for unusual activity
- Log authentication failures

## API Key Management

### Creating Keys via API

You can also create API keys programmatically using the API Keys endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://firemoon.studio/api/keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Production API key",
    "scope": "full_access"
  }'
```

<Note>
  API key creation requires authentication via your user session. For automated key management, use the dashboard at [firemoon.studio/keys](https://firemoon.studio/keys).
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check that you're using the `Bearer` prefix
- Ensure the key hasn't expired

### 403 Forbidden
- Confirm your key has access to the requested provider
- Check if you've exceeded rate limits
- Verify your account is in good standing
